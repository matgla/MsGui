Overview
========

**MsGUI** is an open-source graphical user interface C++ library.
It can be used in projects where hardware resources are very constrained.

The project main goal is to provide easy to use GUI library for embedded devices.

Library was planned to be part of MsOS (TODO: link) environment. But can be used standalone.

Goals
=====

MsGUI should meets those goals:

- Configurable to be used in different environments, like:

    a. using frame buffer or not
    b. using chunk or pixel base rendering
    c. allowing user to provide custom driver, policies, etc.
- Small memory footprint
- Easy to be used with readable client code syntax
